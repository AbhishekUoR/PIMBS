Emerging nonvolatile memories(NVRAMs)\r\n  endow researchers in memory architectures the capability to\r\n  combine the two in computer design. In order to assist researchers\r\n  in related fields of Computer Architecture to study\r\n  emerging persistent memory systems such as PMFS [1], this\r\n  paper proposes and characterizes a benchmark suite for persistent\r\n  memory(PIMBS), including different types of applications\r\n  and multiple workloads targeting at persistent memory\r\n  system designs, as well as a set of high level metrics\r\n  specified for persistent memory systems. Our characterizations\r\n  show that the PIMBS covers a wide range of persistence\r\n  patterns, performance, and efficiency, leading to some\r\n  important insights in architectural aspects, such as the growing\r\n  importance of memory-bandwidth limitations and the\r\n  consequent importance of atomicity, consistency, isolation,\r\n  and durability(ACID).\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n#### First Author\r\n[Ziyang Qi]( @qizy09 )\r\n#### Co-authors\r\n[Xiao Liu](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~xiszishu/), [Jishen Zhao](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jzhao/), [Yuan Xie](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n    For any questions, feel free to let me know.","google":"UA-73383993-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
