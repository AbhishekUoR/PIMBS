## Abstract
```
  Memory architectures of modern computer systems adopt a
  two-level scheme: fast volatile and fine-grained addressable
  memory for temporary storage, and slower devices for permanent
  storage. Emerging nonvolatile memories(NVRAMs)
  endow researchers in memory architectures the capability to
  combine the two in computer design. In order to assist researchers
  in related fields of Computer Architecture to study
  emerging persistent memory systems such as PMFS [1], this
  paper proposes and characterizes a benchmark suite for persistent
  memory(PIMBS), including different types of applications
  and multiple workloads targeting at persistent memory
  system designs, as well as a set of high level metrics
  specified for persistent memory systems. Our characterizations
  show that the PIMBS covers a wide range of persistence
  patterns, performance, and efficiency, leading to some
  important insights in architectural aspects, such as the growing
  importance of memory-bandwidth limitations and the
  consequent importance of atomicity, consistency, isolation,
  and durability(ACID).
